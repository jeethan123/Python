> Variables

* Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. It means that when    
  you create a variable, you reserve some space in the memory.

* Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what 
  can be stored in the reserved memory.

> Assigning Values to Variables

* Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration 
  happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used 
  to assign values to variables.
  The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to 
  the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable.

* counter = 100 # An integer assignment
  miles = 1000.0 # A floating point
  name = "John" # A string

  print (counter)
  >100

  print (miles)
  >1000.0

  print (name)
  >John

> Multiple Assignment

  a = b = c = 1
. Here, an integer object is created with the value 1, and all the three variables are assigned 
  to the same memory location. You can also assign multiple objects to multiple variables. 

a, b, c = 1, 2, "john"

. Here, two integer objects with values 1 and 2 are assigned to the variables a and b 
  respectively, and one string object with the value "john" is assigned to the variable c.
